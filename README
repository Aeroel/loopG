**Stuff I find odd**:
When I press left or right, the movement seems responsive, but if I press up or down, sometimes it seems like the request to move is ignored, feels kinda unresponsive and bad/meh. Why this happens, I am not sure since I do not fully understand the movement system I put in place.
