**Stuff I find odd**:
When I press left or right, the movement seems responsive, but if I press up or down, sometimes it seems like the request to move is ignored, feels kinda unresponsive and bad/meh. Why this happens, I am not sure since I do not fully understand the movement system I put in place.

How to install on Windows or Android:
First of all, for android I need termux with node installed.
The steps are pretty much identical on windows and android
1. Clone repo
2. Go to server directory and start node on "startThisToStartTheGameServer.js". 
The server is now started on some port that I will see in the console or even in some config file I think.
3. Then go to client folder and do something like "pnpx light-server .". Note the dot in the quotes of the pnpx command.
Well, these are all the steps so far. Now just go to the localhost where the light-server started.

Okay, so I will describe the general idea,
there are train tracks. Trains move on them like a metro basically. They stop at train stations and so on, you get the idea.

So, this functionality isn't quite implemented yet.
